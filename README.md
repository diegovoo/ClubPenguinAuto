Auto buy cards is a script used to batch buy Card-Jitsu. It can also be
used to batch buy any other item, but there's few items appart from cards
that can be bought more than once.

minute.

When run, the script is gonna ask you to hover over the buy button, which
is the one that has the numer of coins, its then going to ask you to hover
over the yes button and that's all. 
note: If it doesn't fully work try to hover over the yes button as right as
possible when asked.
